Deep Recurrent Neural Network



All I want the readme to do is tell me why you need to do these eight steps and why RNNs need data in this format to function correctly. If you have questions about my expectations, please ask and reread the assignment. Please zip up your code and the readme. 


We completed the following 8 steps that make up the preprocessing process:

1: Removing null or meaningless datapoints.

We had to remove all null and meaningless datapoints

2: Making all the data all lower case.

We want tose words to count the same......

3: Removing symbols, punctuation, brackets, parenthesis and special characters.

4: Removing repetitive and meaningless characters.

5: Removing stop words.

6: Tokenize the remaining natural language.

7: Transform the language into a numerical representation.

8: Pad those embeddings so taht all input is the same length.
